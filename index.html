									<h2>My portfolio</h2>
									<p>I am Ayomide David Sayo-Adeyemi, a passionate and versatile professional with expertise in software engineering, UX/UI design, and graphic design. As a Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary, I have developed strong technical skills in React, Firebase Firestore, and C programming. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and have built projects like an inventory management system that enhances efficiency and organization. With a resilient approach to project management, I thrive in balancing technical problem-solving with creativity to develop impactful solutions.</p>

<p>Beyond software development, I have a deep passion for UX/UI design, where I focus on creating seamless and user-friendly digital experiences. I prioritize accessibility, usability, and visual appeal to ensure that every product I design is both functional and engaging. My background in software development allows me to bridge the gap between design and implementation, ensuring that user experiences are intuitive, efficient, and visually compelling.</p>

<p>I am also a graphic designer under the alias @_fadedvisuals, where I specialize in cover art, branding, and digital visuals. Through my design work, I bring ideas to life with a unique blend of creativity and storytelling. I have worked with brands, artists, and businesses to craft visuals that not only look great but also resonate deeply with their audiences. My ability to merge technical expertise with artistic vision allows me to create designs that are both innovative and meaningful.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges in the fields of software development, UI/UX design, and digital creativity. My diverse skill set, strong work ethic, and adaptability make me a valuable asset to any forward-thinking team. I am looking for opportunities where I can contribute my skills, collaborate with like-minded professionals, and create impactful digital experiences that make a difference.</p>

									<p>This Express.js app serves dynamic content with EJS templating. It listens on port 3000, renders index.ejs for the root route, and generates a random name from predefined arrays upon form submission. It also includes dynamic year display in the footer and applies CSS from the public directory.</p>

									<p>This HTML document sets up a web page for a Simon game. The page displays a header with the text "Press A Key to Start" and includes four colored buttons (green, red, yellow, and blue) arranged in a grid. The buttons are styled using a linked CSS file, "styles.css," and a custom font from Google Fonts. The game functionality, likely involving pattern recognition and player interaction, is handled by a JavaScript file, "game.js," with jQuery included for ease of DOM manipulation.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="./ProjectShowcase/Dice Game/Screenshot 2024-07-26 130150.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This HTML document creates a simple dice-rolling game web page called "Dicee." It features a header that says "Refresh Me," encouraging users to refresh the page to roll the dice. There are two sections labeled "Player 1" and "Player 2," each displaying an image of a dice face showing six dots. The page includes links to an external CSS file for styling, Google Fonts for custom fonts, and a JavaScript file, "index.js," which likely handles the dice-rolling logic.</p>
